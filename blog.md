# A good design saves life!!
**I bet everyone had tried to solve computaional problem from writing code without design when they are Rookie.**
Although I will deny that I am a Rookie right now, I did throw myslef into coding without any design. It turns out to be **frustrated and wasting time**, with no doubt.

Does this look familiar?
I hope so, this language expression is really helpful when it comes to the financing market. When you are required to do background handling for stock buying and selling, what kind of parser will you use to parse this grammar? In my case, Lax parsing isn't my first choice(except that we are required to do so). When I first encountered this grammar, I thought the scannar would work pretty perfect on parsing the input statments. Why bother to use lax? 
**While**
It always comes to a while, the normal coding style using scannar has lots of code repeat and highy inefficiency!
