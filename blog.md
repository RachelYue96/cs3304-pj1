# A good design saves life!!
**I bet everyone had tried to solve computaional problem from writing code without design when they are Rookie.**
Although I will deny that I am a Rookie right now, I did throw myslef into coding without any design. It turns out to be **frustrated and wasting time**, with no doubt. So, here was my project --- write a parser to parse the grammar below.

Does this look familiar?
I hope so, this language expression is really helpful and the project senario is that you are required to do background handling for stock buying and selling. What kind of parser will you use to parse this grammar? In my case, lax parsing isn't my first choice(except that we are required to do so). When I first encountered this grammar, I thought the scannar would work pretty perfect on parsing the input statments. Why bother to use lax? 
**While**
It always comes to a while, the normal coding style using scannar has lots of code repeating and is highly inefficiency, which I indeed found out after I wrote a lax parser and compared them. I felt it was way easier to write a lax parser in paper instead of in code. It might because I didn't actually employ any design, instead, I kinda follow my own instinct or feeling on how the lax parser works. I had to say that I paid a lot extra time on implementing a functioning lax parser. And it wasn't the first time that I directly jumped to the coding part. I had to admit that it was really a bad habit when it comes to an actually world project. A good design algorithm can clear your mind and smooth the coding process. And it definetly worth the time. Coding is no different with math. In math, we pursue the best method or the simpliest method to conduct the result, so does coding. The effiency of the code really matters. And the time you spend on coding also matters. **Don't throw yourself into coding without having a design algorithm! It's wasting time and time is money!!!**
